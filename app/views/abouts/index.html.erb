        Left <br/>
        <br>Left-wing politics describes the range of political ideologies that support and seek to
        achieve social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social
        hierarchy. <br/>
        Left-wing politics typically involve a concern for those in society whom its
        adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there
        are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished.<br/>
        Left-wing politics are also associated with popular or state control of major political and
        economic institutions. <br/>

        <br> Right <br/>
        Right-wing politics describes the range of political ideologies that view certain social
        orders and hierarchies as inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable, typically
        supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics, authority, property or tradition. <br/>
        Hierarchy and inequality may be seen as natural results of traditional social differences or competition
        in market economies.<br/>

        <br> Center <br/>
        Centrism is a political outlook or position involving acceptance or support of a
        balance of social equality and a degree of social hierarchy while opposing political
        changes that would result in a significant shift of society strongly to the left or the
        right.<br/>
